        <h1>
            Rose Darling
        </h1>

        <p>
            There was a rose.
        </p>

        <p>
            And a rosebush where
            <br />
            A whippoorwhill sang:
            <br />
            "Poor Will, whipped! 
            <br />
            "Poor, poor Will..."
        </p>

        <p>
            And where there's a Will,
            <br />
            There's always some whey
            <br />
            Whey-faced, disgraced:
            <br />
            Wheyboy, whey:
            <br />
            Is it your churn yet?
        </p>

        <p>
            Across the rosedark sea
            <br />
            Waveboy, wave
            <br />
            Wave for they are a-comin'
        </p>

        <p>
            And coming near they clatter
            <br />
            Like skull-braids tumbling
            <br />
            Down the temple steps
        </p>

        <p>
            Rosedark sea, oh now you see
            <br />
            It is not to be!
            <br />
            Cause it's all over
            <br />
            A four-leafed clover
            <br />
            My lovely lassie, Baby Grue
        </p>

        <p>
            Grue: What if it were true?
            <br />
            All the same until today
            <br />
            And all the blame tomorrow?
        </p>

        <p>
            All are game until today
            <br />
            And all are grim tomorrow
            <br />
            What fixed point is the end?
            <br />
            A rose of constant sorrow
        </p>

        <p>
            Sam I am, Sam I am
            <br />
            Would I have to borrow?
            <br />
            Soldier boy, soldier toy
            <br />
            A rose of constant sorrow
        </p>

        <p>
            Back to three...
            <br />
            Leave us be!
            <br />
            To sail the rosedark sea
        </p>

        <p>
            And chant our Hail Mary
            <br />
            full of Greece
            <br />
            along the rosedark sea
        </p>

        <p>
            Where in your ship
            <br />
            Paul is with thee
            <br />
            upon the rosedark sea
        </p>

        <p>
            Once reaching shore
            <br />
            Blossomed are thou
            <br />
            Amongst all of we men
        </p>

        <p>
            And blossomed is the fruit
            <br />
            Of the wounded Jesus,
            <br />
            Hanging o'er the rosedark sea
        </p>

        <p>
            And now we plunge us
            <br />
            Down <i>too</i> deep
            <br />
            Beneath the rosedark sea
        </p>

        <p>
            We pray onboard
            <br />
            Our souls do weep
            <br />
            They rose in constant sorrow
        </p>

        <p>
            And out on the sea
            <br />
            Where Odysseus be
            <br />
            Rose waves of constant sorrow
        </p>

        <p>
            There Captain Drake
            <br />
            No doubt a fake
            <br />
            Fransican robes did borrow
        </p>

        <p>
            And Admiral Nelson
            <br />
            One-eyed past Corsica
            <br />
            Was shot dead at Trafalgar
        </p>

        <p>
            Our heroes wail
            <br />
            They rant and rail:
            <br />
            "What a fate! Lost at sea,
            <br />
            "'Neath waves of constant sorrow!"
        </p>
